# AWS Quickstart EKS Shared Service Platform
## Sample Implementation

This is a sample implementation of the Shared Services Platform Quickstart by AWS, using the Weave GitOps Core Addon and the `bootstrap` sample found in this repository.

It demonstrates the creation of multiple teams, and uses the `RBAC` objects created for those teams in `IAM` as well as Kubernetes, to provide a secure encapsulation for the team workloads.
